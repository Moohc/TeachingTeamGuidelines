# Masquerade

This feature can be used only by **course administrators**, **teachers** and **course moderators**. It is a very handy tool to search or create a user. It is not advisable for teachers to create a user, however they forward a request to the admins for the creation.  
This tool allows you to enter inside the user account of a particular user without the need to login. Upon gaining access, you can view and modify the account just like the user itself.  
We use this tool to troubleshoot any account related issues faced by the user.

As you can see in *Fig. 04*, there is a red ribbon on the top of the screen which indicates that we are in masquerade mode. Here, you can view and modify the profile, courses, settings etc.  
Once you are done with your stipulated work, click on the **DEMASQ** button situated at the top right side (as shown in the *Fig. 04*) to return back to your own page.
