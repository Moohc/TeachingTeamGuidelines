----------

## Document Types

You can offer different types of certificates on the platform: 

- **Confirmation of Participation (CoP)**  
Everyone who has visited at least 50% of the course material receives a confirmation of participation. This threshold can be set for each course. We recommend that this threshold value be set uniformly for all courses throughout the platform.  
The CoP contains the following information:  Name of participant, date of birth (optional), course title and summary

- **Record of Achievement (RoA)**  
You are eligible for a Record of Achievement if you have earned more than 50 percent of the available points in the weekly assignments and the final exam. The Record of Achievement contains the following information:

  - Participant's name
  - Date of birth (optional)
  - Course title and summary
  - Credits earned
  - Course performance (if you're among the top 5%, 10%, or 20% of participants)
  - Anti-counterfeit link and QR code
 
- **Open Badges**  
If you’ve earned a Record of Achievement, then your open badge comes along with it and can be found on your certificates page. You can download the badge to your computer and upload it to a badge backpack of your choice, such as badgr or Open Badge Passport.

- **Qualified Certificate**  
On openHPI, we also offer qualified certificates for many courses. A qualified certificate contains the participant’s photo and a supplement with detailed course information. 
The participant agrees to be proctored via webcam during the graded exercises and exams. With the help of this online proctoring technology, we determine that the registered user is taking the assignments and the final exam in person. If you are interested in offering this kind of certificate, please contact the openHPI team.
