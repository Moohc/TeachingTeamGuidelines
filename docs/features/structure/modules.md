# Modules

A course consists of modules.  
Modules can represent a certain period of time or a certain context.  
The course is not published in its entirety at once, but rather the modules are gradually activated. In this way, the learners are “synchronized,” and consequently deal with the same topics and questions at the same time.  
Alternatively, courses can also be configured so that there are no fixed dates for test submission or course conclusion.
