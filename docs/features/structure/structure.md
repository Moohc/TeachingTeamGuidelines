# Structure

Structural elements of the platform: 
* Courses 
* Modules 
* Learning units 
* Certificates  
  
The largest unit of the platform are the courses.    
Learning units that form the basic structure of the course: 
* Videos 
* Texts
* Quizzes and Exams  
    
Courses are divided into modules.  

Modules consist of learning units.  

Learning units are not only made up of videos and texts but also consist of interactive and assessment elements, such as quizzes and other tasks. This structure is further reflected in the roles and rights concepts of the platform.  

Fine-grained permissions can be granted for a course as well as for the whole platform and are flexibly configurable.
