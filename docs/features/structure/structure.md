# Structure

In the following section we will look in detail at the components that make up the functional extent of the platform:

* Structural elements of the platform: courses, modules, and learning units as well as the certificates, which are closely linked to the courses.
* Learning units that form the basic structure of the courses and consist of videos, quizzes and texts.
* Specialized learning units, such as peer assessment and team work.
* Analysis capability of the platform.  
  
## Structure: Courses ∙ Modules ∙ Learning Units
  
The largest unit of the platform are the courses, which are divided into modules. Modules consist of learning units. Learning units are not only made up of videos and texts but also consist of interactive and assess- ment elements, such as quizzes and other tasks. This structure is further reflected in the roles and rights concepts of the platform. Fine-grained permissions can be granted for a course as well as for the whole platform and are flexibly configurable.
