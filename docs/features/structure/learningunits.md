# Learning Units

The smallest units in the course are called “learning units” or “learning materials.”  
These units are not indivisible but consist of several components that can be broken down further depending on the type of element involved. For instance, a video can consist of one to three video streams. Optional additions could be presentation slides, extra explanatory texts, transcripts and subtitles in different languages.  
The most common learning contents used on the HPI platforms are learning videos, quizzes and the provided reading material.
