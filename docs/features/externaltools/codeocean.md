# CodeOcean

----------
This is not part of the openHPI platform.

CodeOcean is an open source tool.

If needed either we can set up a separate instance for the tool or the platform owners can setup their own instance.  

TODO add basic information about functionality and link to github repository.

Details are to be discussed.
