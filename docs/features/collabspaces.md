# Collab Spaces

Every course participant can create a collab space.  
All course participants can enter an open collab space.  

Collab spaces offer the following benefits:  

* Smaller groups within a course 
* Possibility to work together 
* Communicate without sharing information with the whole course population

For closed collab space
* Participants need to first apply for membership to gain entry 
* Request for membership must be confirmed by the **founder** of the collab space before admission into the group  

Besides offering a members-only discussion forum, learning spaces provide a whole range of other communication and collaboration tools:   

* Video Conference 
* Collaborative text editing 
* File Sharing 
* neXboard (collaborative digital whiteboard)  

Besides the participant-initiated groups described, the teaching team can also create teams and to give team members tasks they must complete together.
