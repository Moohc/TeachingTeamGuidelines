# Collab Spaces

Collab spaces offer smaller groups within a course the possibility to work together or to communicate without the whole course population knowing their shared information.  
Every course participant is able to create a collab space.  
All course participants can enter an open collab space.  
With a closed collab space, participants need to first apply for membership to gain entry.  
A request for membership must be confirmed by the founder of the collab space before the participant is actually admitted into the group.  
Besides offering a members-only discussion forum, learning spaces provide a whole range of other communication and collaboration tools:   

* Video Conference 
* Collaborative text editing 
* File Sharing 
* neXboard (collaborative digital whiteboard)  

Besides the participant-initiated groups described, the teaching team is also able to create teams and to give team members tasks they must complete together.
