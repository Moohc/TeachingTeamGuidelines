Text documents can also be integrated into a course as a learning unit.  
A limited number of text formatting options (Markdown) are available on the platform.  
Images and links to other websites or to downloadable PDFs may be embedded in the text.  
An adaption and change of the formatting is possible within the framework of the CI Guidelines.

It is always advisable to add contents for the text item in **Markdown** format and should limit the usage of **HTML**.  
This allows the text pages to be displayed as intended on openHPI mobile application.
