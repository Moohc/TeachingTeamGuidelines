# Text

Text documents can also be integrated into a course as a learning unit.  
A limited number of text formatting options (Markdown) are available on the platform.  
Images and links to other websites or to downloadable PDFs may be embedded in the text.  
An adaption and change of the formatting is possible within the framework of the CI Guidelines.

Although the text items actually support both **HTML** and **Markdown**, the use of **HTML** is strongly discouraged except for few rare use cases. The mobile applications do not render the HTML tags but display them as source code.
