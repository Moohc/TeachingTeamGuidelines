# Video

The HPI platform employs a dual-stream video player with slide navigation.

The instructor is on one side and the presentation is on the other.   
The learner can flexibly switch between a picture-in-picture variation (preferred for mobile devices) and the dual stream variation.  
The talking speed of the speaker (video playback speed) can be adjusted flexibly.  
The accompanying slides as well as subtitles in several languages may be provided below the video.  
Furthermore, it is possible to place extra texts below the videos (e.g. errata).

Moreover, course providers, but also participants, can start discussions directly on the video playback page and ask video-related questions, which are then automatically assigned to this video and simultaneously enter the global discussion forum of the course.   
Another feature of the course is the slide navigator, which allows participants to quickly track specific content in the video.
