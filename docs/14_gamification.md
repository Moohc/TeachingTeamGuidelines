Badges are displayed on the user's dashboard and the user's private profile page.
All available badges are displayed here. 
As long as they are not greyed out, the user has not received the badge, it's just a placeholder.


## Experience Points

Users receive experience points (XP) for the following actions:

### Communication

- User answers a forum question: 1 XP
- User receives an upvote on a question: 5 XP
- User receives an upvote on an answer: 10 XP

### Speed

XPs are displayed in the top navigation (when a user is logged in) and more detailed on the user's private profile page.
