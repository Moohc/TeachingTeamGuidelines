# Curriculum Design

In general, a course week consists of the following elements:

 - **Welcome Message**: A short text (Text Page) which gives an overview about the upcoming course week and leads to the next important course dates and assignment deadlines. 

 - **Videos and Self-Tests** (Quizzes): Videos and linked self-tests (quizzes) make up the main part of the course content. The clips shouldn’t be longer than 10 minutes. Self-tests (2-5-questions) should recap most important findings from the videos. 

 - **Additional Readings**: At the end of a learning week (prior to publishing the weekly assignments) a text page with links to additional readings is provided (Web-Links, PDF-documents, collected slides of the week, etc.). There should also be a provision for downloading the course material as a zip file.

 - **Weekly Assignments and Sample Solutions**: The last item of a week is the quiz, which will make up the weekly assignment. In order to create the sample solution the textual explanation possibilities offered in the quiz system (either at question and answer level) should be used. If the publishing date of the sample solution is stated correctly, the publishing of the answers will be carried out automatically after the quiz deadline has passed.  
 Participants will get only **ONE attempt** to finish the test or exam. The following marking scheme should be followed:
 
 <center>
 
   | Details     | Max Points  | Duration    |
   |:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
   | Weekly Test | 15 points   | 60 mins     |
   | Final Exam  | 90 points   | 120 mins    |
   
 </center>

 - **Additional Learning Material** (Optional): Further videos, self-tests and excursus with learning material can be added after the weekly assignments. But only if these doesn’t belong to the actual learnings relevant to the contents of the weekly assignments. It is important to highlight these facts on the relevant pages.

 - **Special Interest Features** (Optional):  

    - *Peer Assessments*: More complex exercises and exams can be created by using the Peer Assessment feature. The participants will hand in a solution for the given task, which can be of any nature (but results in an digital artefact that can be uploaded to the platform). The submissions will be graded by peers, other participants, who have also participated in the same task. Grading and reviewing a certain amount of submissions is mandatory. The amount of required reviews is defined by the instructors.   
   (**Remark**: This assessment type can severely increase the workload for both participants and teaching team.)
   
    - *Team Peer Assessments*: Peer assessments can can also be defined as team tasks. The teams are formed by the instructors with the support of a tool provided by the openHPI Team. If you're interested in employing a team assignment, please contact the openHPI team.

    - *Coding Exercises with Automated Grading*: coding exercises in almost any programming language can be assigned using the add-on tool [CodeOcean](https://github.com/openHPI/codeocean). Upon submitting the exercises, the points will be automatically reflected in openHPI platform. CodeOcean is an open source project offered by the openHPI team. If you want to employ CodeOcean exercises in your courses, you will have to deploy and operate a CodeOcean instance on your own servers or contact the openHPI team.

    - *Custom Exercises*: Teaching teams can invent and integrate almost any kind of exercise using the platform's [LTI interface](http://www.imsglobal.org/lti/).
