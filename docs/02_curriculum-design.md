# Curriculum Design

In general, a course week consists of the following elements:

 - **Welcome Message**: A short text (Text Page) which gives an overview about the upcoming course week and leads to the next important course dates and assignment deadlines. 

 - **Videos and Self-Tests** (Quizzes): Videos and linked self-tests (quizzes) make up the main part of the course content. The clips shouldn’t be longer than 10 minutes. Self-tests (2-5-questions) should recap most important findings from the videos. 

 - **Additional Readings**: At the end of a learning week (prior to publishing the weekly assignments) a text page with links to additional readings is provided (Web-Links, PDF-documents, collected slides of the week, etc.). There should also be a provision for downloading the course material as a zip file.

 - **Weekly Assignments and Sample Solutions**: The last item of a week is the quiz, which will make up the weekly assignment. In order to create the sample solution the textual explanation possibilities offered in the quiz system (either at question and answer level) should be used. If the publishing date of the sample solution is stated correctly, the publishing of the answers will be carried out automatically after the quiz deadline has passed.  
 Participants will get only **ONE attempt** to finish the test or exam. The following marking scheme should be followed:  <center>
   | Details   | Max Points  | Duration |
   |:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
   | Weekly Test | 15 points | 60 mins |
   | Final Exam  | 90 points | 120 mins |
   |             |           |
   

   </center>

 - **Additional Learning Material** (Optional): Further videos, self-tests and excursus with learning material can be added after the weekly assignments. But only if these doesn’t belong to the actual learnings relevant to the contents of the weekly assignments. It is important to highlight these facts on the relevant pages.

 - **Special Interest Features** (Optional):  

   - *Team Peer Assessments*: More complex exercises and exams can be created by using the Peer Assessment feature. Students have to form a team either by random assignment or personal choice. The team will hand in one solution for the given task, which can be of any nature. The submissions will be graded as a teamwork, however individual students might score bonus points based on their performance in the team. The second part of this assessment type is the obligatory grading of a certain amount of submissions from their peers by the participants. Collaboration is made possible by collab spaces, Etherpad or Google Hangout.   
   (**Remark**: This assessment type can severely increase the workload for both participants and teaching team.)

   - *Coding Exercises with Automated Grading*: coding exercises in almost any programming language can be assigned using the add-on tool [CodeOcean](https://github.com/openHPI/codeocean). Upon submitting the exercises, the points will be automatically reflected in openHPI platform.

   - *Custom Exercises*: Teaching teams can invent and integrate almost any kind of exercise using the platform's [LTI interface](http://www.imsglobal.org/lti/).
