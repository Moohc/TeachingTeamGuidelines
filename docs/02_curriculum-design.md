## Curriculum Design ##

In general, a course week consists of the following elements:

 - **Welcome Message**: A short text (Text Page) which gives an overview about the upcoming course week and leads to the next important course dates and assignment deadlines. 
 - **Videos and Self-Tests** (Quizzes): Videos and linked self-tests (quizzes) make up the main part of the course content. The clips shouldn’t extend a length of 10 minutes. Self-tests (quizzes) should take up and recap most important findings from the videos. (2-5-questions). 
 - **Additional Readings**: at the end of a learning week (prior publishing the weekly assignments) a text page with links to additional readings is provided (Web-Links, PDF-documents, collected slides of the week, etc.)
 - **Weekly Assignments** and Sample Solutions: the last Item of a week is the quiz, which will make up the weekly assignment. In order to create the sample solution the textual explanation possibilities offered in the quiz system (either at question and answer level) should be used. If the publishing date of the sample solution is stated correctly, the publishing of the answers will be carried out automatically after the quiz deadline has passed.
 - **Additional Learning Material** (Optional): further videos, self-tests and pages with learning material can be added after the weekly assignments. But only if these don’t belong to the actual learnings relevant to the contents of the weekly assignments. It is important to highlight these facts on the relevant pages.
 - **Time Zone**: All times mentioned on the platforn are indicated in UTC. It is important to point this out repeatedly to the participants.
