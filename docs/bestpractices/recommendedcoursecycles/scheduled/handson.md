# Hands-on

One course format that is offered successfully on the openHPI platform are so-called Hands-on courses.
Generally, we offer these courses in a duration of **4 weeks** with a strong focus on hands-on exercises and tasks.
In our context, these are often courses to learn programming skills.

Next to multiple choice tests, these courses often also contain hands-on assignments, such as auto-graded programming exercises.
Peer assessed tasks are possible. We recommend, however, to offer peer assessments only as bonus tasks. Otherwise, the generally higher workload might result on lower completion rates.

The duration of the course is basically defined by the deadlines of assignemnts and exercises. The course material itself is generally available in self-paced mode after the deadlines have passed. 

During the runtime of the course, the course forum is open for discussions among the participants and support by the teaching team. 

**Records of Achievement** can be earned during the runtime of the course. **Confirmations of Participation** can be earned during the course runtime and also in self-paced mode. **Certificates** are not offered in Hands-on courses.
