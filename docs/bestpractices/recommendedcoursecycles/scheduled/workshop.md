# Workshop

Generally, these courses have a duration of **2 weeks**.
Depending on the type of the course, graded assignments might be offered or not. 

The duration of the course is basically defined by the deadlines of graded assignments and exercises. The course material itself is generally available in self-paced mode after the deadlines have passed. During the runtime of the course, the course forum is open for discussions among the participants and support by the teaching team. 

Although, Workshops also are a little too short by definition to offer enough room for a peer assessment, this exercise type still might be a good choice due to the hands-on, project-based character of these courses. It is very important, however, to clearly communicate from the start that participants might have to spend more than the two weeks of official course runtime to fully complete all course tasks. We also recommend to offer peer assessments mainly as bonus tasks as otherwise, the course might have a lower completion rate. 

If the course offers graded assignments, **Records of Achievement** can be earned during the runtime of the course. **Confirmations of Participation** can be earned during the course runtime and also in self-paced mode. **Certificates** are not offered in Workshops.
