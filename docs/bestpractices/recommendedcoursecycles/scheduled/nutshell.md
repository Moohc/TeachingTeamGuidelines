# Nutshell

These are very short courses that introduce a topic aimed at beginners to explain specific concepts based on the respective topics covered in the course to further motivate participants on taking related courses.  

These courses might last up to **2 weeks** and there might be graded assignments at the end of each week, however, there will not be any final examinations.  

The duration of the course is basically defined by the deadlines of assignemnts and exercises. The course material itself is generally available in self-paced mode after the deadlines have passed. 

**Records of Achievement** can be earned during the runtime of the course. **Confirmations of Participation** can be earned during the course runtime and also in self-paced mode. **Certificates** are not offered in Nutshell-courses.
