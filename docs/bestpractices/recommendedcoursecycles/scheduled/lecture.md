# Lecture

The main course format on openHPI are courses that have been adapted from on-site lectures at the HPI to suit the online format.

Generally, we offer these courses in a duration of **6 weeks**. The focus is generally more theoretical than in the hands-on courses, still we often try to enhance these courses with some practical exercises or assignments.  

Each course week offers a weekly assignment and the course is concluded with a final exam. 
All graded assignments have deadlines. These deadlines define the 6-week duration. The course materials, however, will still be available when all the deadlines have passed.

Additionally, to the weekly assignments the platform allows to offer peer assessed tasks and exercises. To learn more about peer assessments, please visit [Peer Assessment](https://teachingteamguidelines.readthedocs.io/#features/itemtypes/peerassessment/) and [Peer Assessment Settings](https://teachingteamguidelines.readthedocs.io/#courseadministration/addcontent/learningunits/peerassessment/).  

**Record of Achievements** and **Certificates** are only available during the actual runtime of the courses. In the near future it will also be possible to set individual deadlines per user (setting individual deadlines will involve costs).

**Confirmations of Participation** can also be earned in self-paced mode after the deadlines have passed.
