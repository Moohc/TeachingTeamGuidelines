# Teaching-Team – Person in charge as per week

The following tasks are required to be controlled by the teaching team:

- Organisation of content creation (e.g. timely recording and post production of videos, preparation of reading materials, etc.).
- Preparation and moderation of editorial meetings for the particular course week.
- Approval of weekly platform content as well as coordination of quality assurance.
- Coordination of fora and support during the course week (together with team leader).
This approach and procedure is not mandatory but it has proven worth in the past.
