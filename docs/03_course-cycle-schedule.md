## Recommended Course Cycle ##

Three course formats have turned out to be successful:

- **full course**: 6 weeks plus an extra week for the final exam. 
- **hands-on course**: 4 weeks, emphazising hands-on exercises, particularly for programming courses.
- **workshop**: 2 weeks course concentrating on a certain concept or enabling the participants to learn a specific skill. Also suitable to extend one of the other formats with certain aspects that are beyond the original course scope.
 
The following demonstrates the **ideal schedule** of a weekly cycle of a 6+1 week course.

*All times are communicated in UTC-time.*

	Monday (week n)
	08:00 Hrs	Publishing of course material of week n
				incl. weekly assignment
				Publishing of final exam (only week 6)
				
	08:00 Hrs	Announcement for course start (only week 1)

	20:00 Hrs	Deadline weekly assignment (week n - 1) or final exam

	Tuesday (week n)
	12:00 Hrs	Publishing of sample solution for 
	            weekly assignments (week n - 1) or final exam
	
	Tuesday / Wednesday / Thursday (week n)
	(optional)	Publishing of additional videos such as tutorials or office hours 

	Monday – Friday (During working Hours)
	Monitoring  of discussion forum, Support via helpdesk and email messages
	
	Friday
	12:00 Hrs	Announcement for week n + 1

**Time Zone**: All times mentioned on the platforn are indicated in UTC. It is important to point this out repeatedly to the participants.
 
### Experience from course supervision & suggestions ###

**Publishing of course materials:**
In practice it turned out to be very well appreciated by the participants when course materials and weekly assignments are published on the Saturday preceding the official start of the week (beginning with week 2.) This allows participants more freedom in their time management without splitting the learning community too much.

**Deadline of weekly assignments:**
It is recommended to schedule the deadline for weekly assignments and final exam at a time when somebody from the teaching team is available for troubleshooting. Many participants tend to procrastinate and start the assignments shortly before the deadline. 

**Publishing of exam results and sample solution:**
We suggest to publish the sample solution the day after the deadline has passed at 12:00 Hrs UTC. This, generally, allows enough time for adaptations or regradings.
Sample solutions should be provided using the "explanations" feature of the platform.
This way the publishing of the sample solution and the communication of this date is handled automatically by the platform (given the settings are correct). Furthermore, only those students that have participated in the assignments will be able to see the results.

**Announcement of the upcoming course week / important deadlines:**
Each Friday course participants receive a course announcement which gives an outlook on the contents of the upcoming course week and an overview of the upcoming deadlines and other important dates. Further, important discussions and questions from the helpdesk can be responded to as well.
Improvements and extension of the platform will be communicated as needed by the platform core team via Global Announcements or Blog Posts.

**Office hours:**
Addressing hot topics in the discussion forums might need too much space for a weekly announcement. In this case "office hours" or "feedback videos" proved to be a good communication tool.

**Individual extension of deadlines:**
Some participants will always demand extensions of deadlines for weekly assignments and final exams. But these cannot be granted out of technical and organisational reasons. Technically, a quiz can only be blocked or released for ALL participants. Organizationally an individual extension of a deadline AFTER the sample solutions have been published, is not very fair anymore towards the learning community.
