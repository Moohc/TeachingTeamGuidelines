# Creating a New Course Iteration

## Clone course
Course Administration menu > Course structure & content.
At the top of the page there is a button "Clone course" (if not, ask your platform administrator to create a clone for you). 
On click, it reveals a text input that allows to enter the **new** course code.
Click on the "Clone course" button again and the course will be cloned.

You can access the cloned course right away unter:  
https://yourinstance.of.theplatform/new_course_code
It might take a few seconds until all elements of the course are available.

### Elements which are not cloned
- Enrollments
- Collab Spaces
- Peer Assessments
- Announcements
- Discussion Forum
- Certificate Templates
- Enrollments
- Permissions
- Properties: Course Status, Course Dates, Release Records
- Learning Objectives


## General
- All deadlines need to be reset (course, sections, items, ...)
- Unlock Forum (if previously locked)
- Check all course items for links to other course specific elements (discussion forum posts, collab spaces, quizzzes, etc.)
- Re-adjust research queries if necessary
- Re-create "pinned" forum threads if necessary
- Check if office hour videos still make sense or need to be recorded again
- Adjust course overview if necessary
- Check for deadlines in texts
- Check if introductory videos and course teaser are still correct (dates/deadlines)
- Communication in the name of the "original" teaching team (if team members change, design a consistent strategy how to deal with that. This strategy should include informing the original teaching team about your plans). 

## Peer Assessment
- Re-create the complete peer assessment if still requested
- In case it is a team peer assessment:
  1. Rename the existing TeamBuilder LTI provider
  2. Create a new TeamBuilder LTI provider (ask your platform admin how to do that/contact the openHPI team)
  3. Edit the cloned TeamBuilder item and replace the old TeamBuilder LTI provider with the new one
  4. Delete the old TeamBuilder LTI provider or mark it as deprecated


## CodeOcean Exercises
- Adjust links in exercise texts
- If an exercise has been used in a previous course (just in case questions might pop-up in the forum):
  1. Old RFCs (Request for comments) might still appear
  2. If a participant has solved an exercise in the previous course, his/her solutions are still visible to him/her.
  3. Do not clone exercises without consulting your contact at openHPI.
