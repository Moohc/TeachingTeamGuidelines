# Type peer assessment
Peer assessment provides the possibility to scale out exercises that can not be graded automatically.
Participants will be enabled to grade each others work.

You can find a general description of the Peer Assessment Feature [here](https://open.hpi.de/pages/p_a)
and an example for the calculation of grades [here](https://open.hpi.de/pages/p_a_grading).

**Exercise type:** Set either *Main* or *Bonus* (Self test and Survey do not make sense here). 
Points for a peer assessment of type *Main* will be added to the amount of achievable points. Points for a peer assessment of type *Bonus* can be used to make up for regular points that have been missed. In this respect peer assessments behave just like standard quizzes. 

**New / existing assessment:** Existing peer assessments can be linked here so that they are accessible from different places. E.g. the submission phase (Week 1) of the assessment might be separated from the grading phase (Week 2). This feature is deprecated, however, and will be discontinued in the future. The recommended best practice is to set up the peer assessment in a separate section of the course.
