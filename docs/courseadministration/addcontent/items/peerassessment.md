# Type peer assessment
Peer assessment provides the possibility to scale out exercises that can not be graded automatically.
Participants will be enabled to grade each others work.

You can find a general description of the Peer Assessment Feature [here](https://open.hpi.de/pages/p_a)
and an example for the calculation of grades [here](https://open.hpi.de/pages/p_a_grading).

**Exercise type:** Can be *Self-test*, *Main*, and *Bonus*. Ignore the *Survey* option.

**New / existing assessment:** Existing peer assessments can be linked here so that they are accessible from different places. E.g. the submission phase (Week 1) of the assessment might be separated from the grading phase (Week 2).
