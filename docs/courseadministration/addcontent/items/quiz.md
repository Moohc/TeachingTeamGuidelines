**Exercise type:** Select between *Self-test*, *Survey*, *Main*, and *Bonus*.
Self-tests are awarded with points, however, they are not counted into the final results at all. Quizzes of type *Main* are the weekly assignments (WA) or the final exam (FE). The sum of their points (plus possibly the points from peer assessments and practical exercises) constitutes the maximum of available points (MaxPoints) in the course. Quizzes of type *Bonus* are not summing up to the MaxPoints, but they can help to compensate points that have been lost in the *Main* assignments.

Example: 

- WA 1 (Main): 15 points
- WA 2 (Main): 15 points
- WA 3 (Main): 15 points
- Excursion (Bonus): 15 points
- FE (Main): 45 points

The participants can achieve a maximum of 90 points.

	User1:

	- WA 1 (Main): 7 points
	- WA 2 (Main): 8 points
	- WA 3 (Main): 6 points
	- Excursion (Bonus): 15 points
	- FE (Main): 35 points

	==> 71 points  


	User 2: 

	- WA 1 (Main): 15 points
	- WA 2 (Main): 15 points
	- WA 3 (Main): 15 points
	- Excursion (Bonus): 15 points
	- FE (Main): 45 points

	==> 90 points

*Surveys* are not rewarded with points, nevertheless, to avoid problems it is better to assign at least 1 point to a survey question. FreeText answers require that at least one answer (dummy) is provided, which needs to be marked as correct. Otherwise, the system will break. 

**Quizzes come with the optimal presets for their exercise type preselected. Change these settings only if you know exactly what you are doing.**

**Maximal points:** These are the maximal points that can be reached for this assignment. The value is read only and results from the sum of the points for the quizzes' questions 

**Submission deadline:** Set the deadline for the quiz. The deadline is hard. After this date it is no more possible to hand in a solution. The results of the participants are autosaved whenever something has changed. When the deadline has passed and the participant is still in the quiz, the results are automatically submitted and the quiz is closed. It is not possible to extend the deadline for single users. In [masquerade mode](todo://link) an admin can submit the quiz for a user even if the deadline has passed. 


**Submission publishing date:** The date when the results for the quiz will be published. Should be after the deadline. Should be set for *Main* and *Bonus* quizzes so that participants cannot spoiler the results in the forum. Self-tests, normally, do not have a deadline or a submission publishing date.

**Instructions:** These will be shown on the *quiz intro page*. The value is mandatory even is *Skip intro page* is on (see below.)

**Unlimited time / Time limit:** Self-tests and Surveys should be set to unlimited time, a good choice for a WA is a time limit of 1h, 2h for the FE.
This of course can be adjusted to your needs. If you e.g. want to make sure that participants can answer question by heart, reduce the time limit so that they have not enough time to look something up.

**Unlimited attempts / Allowed attempts:** *Self-tests* are provided with unlimited attempts, attempts for *Main* and *Bonus* exercises should be limited. *Surveys* need to be limited to one attempt.
