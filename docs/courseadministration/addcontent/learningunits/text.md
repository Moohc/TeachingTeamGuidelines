# Type Text

The provision of reading material can be generally carried out in three forms: 

 - directly as a text-page, 
 - as a PDF download, or 
 - as a web link

Text-pages can be formatted in markdown, it is possible to include images, weblinks, and links to files. 

Downloads can be provided directly through the platform. In those regions of the platform where this possibility exists, a data upload field is provided for this purpose.

Downloads and web links have to be linked from within a text page.

To link a file for download:

- Upload the file via the drop zone.
- Click on the add image icon and select the file that you have just uploaded.
- In the text field: remove the "!" in front of the link. And add some meaningful text within the brackets (see fig. 07.)
