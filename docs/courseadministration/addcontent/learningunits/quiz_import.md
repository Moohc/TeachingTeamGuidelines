# Using the Spread Sheet for Quiz Import
For adding a quiz you can either use the quiz editor of the platform (as described here) or you can insert all questions and answers in a Google Spread Sheet. Often this is the preferred way to do it as it saves time and you can adapt and reuse it for other courses.

# Important note:
- Please do not change the format of the spread sheet because in this case the import will not work any more. You may delete whole lines or columns, that you do not need. 
- Work in the spread sheet we sent to you and do not use an internal copy of it. This would also affect the import of the spread sheet in the course platform.

# How to fill in the Spread Sheet
The spreadsheet consists of different sheets. Every sheet can be imported separately. Usually, there is one sheet per week and one extra sheet for the final exam. In the following we want to give an overview of the fields that are required:
