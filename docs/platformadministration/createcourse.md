# Create a new course

To create a new course, you need to have platform administration permissions.

In the *platform administration* dropdown menu, you will find a list item *Courses*. Clicking on it will open an overview of all courses that are available on the platform. You will also find a button *Create new course there*. This button will open a new *Course properties* form (see [Course properties](https://teachingteamguidelines.readthedocs.io/#courseadministration/courseproperties/) for details of the form).  


The platform administrator generally just sets up a new course with the minimal (required) settings and then hands over to the course administrator or the teaching team.

Depending on your organizational structure, platform and course administrator might be the same or different persons. If they are different persons, it also depends on your organization to which of the roles the responsibilities are assigned.

The platform just requires the following to create a course:

* **Course code:** this is the only setting that cannot be changed later on (see details below).
* **Description:** you could add a dummy/default text here.
* **Language:** select any from the list, this can be changed anytime.

## Defining a course code schema

The course code cannot be changed, once the course has been created. Before starting to use the platform, you should therefore set up a schema how to create these course codes and stick to it.

The course code can only contain URL compatible characters. ASCII letters, numbers and - or _. No spaces, no umlauts or other non-ASCII characters. Furthermore, the course code needs to be unique.

If you use cryptic or verbose course codes is up to your taste. In our experience it is helpful if it is easy to remember.

As you probably will have more than one iterations of some courses, it pays to think about a scheme how to do this.
It could be based either on the year or the number of iterations of the course (or a combination of both). You also might have different versions of a course that build on each other.

Here's an example:

* java2018-1 (could be either the first part of a course or the first iteration of the course)
* java2018-2 (could be either the second part (different content than part 1) of a course or the second iteration of the course (same content as iteration 1)

It is up to you to define the schema for your course codes, we strongly recommend, however, to define it in a way that allows you to always follow the same pattern and don't have to think about again and again.
